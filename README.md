# About the Project

This would be an demo of a social-educational app. Through it, the user will get a service of organizing their own study hours throughout the week, many different factors are taken into account to make some personalization possible, within reason.

**MVP** : 
1. Deliver a weekly study timetable with minimal clicking and maximum value.
2. Allow users to regain control of focus during study time, by keeping relevant interactions in (in-app study chat & QA), and unnecessary distractions out.
3. Provide a semi-direct and instantaneous feedback on performance and a valuable reference point for future projections.
