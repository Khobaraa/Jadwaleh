This would be an demo of a social-educational app. Through it, the user will get a service of organizing their own study hours throughout the week, many different factors are taken into account to make some personalization possible, within reason.

#### Entity Relationship Diagram

**MVP** : 1. Deliver a weekly study timetable with minimal clicking and maximum value. 2. Allow users to regain control of focus during study time, by keeping relevant interactions in \(in-app study chat & QA\), and unnecessary distractions out. 3. Provide a semi-direct and instantaneous feedback on performance and a valuable reference point for future projections.
